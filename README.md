Project: Recipes

This is the first Project to be completed in The Odin Project. It is used to showcase basic HTML skills before moving on to CSS. I have created a website that displays a list of recipes. The ingredients are in Unordered Lists. The recipe instructions are in ordered lists. I used horizontal rule tags in order to create simple division on the site.
